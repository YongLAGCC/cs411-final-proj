Get a Recommendation

The “get a movie recommendation” button will pull up a page with a list of recommendations for them based on movies they've seen, using factors like actors, directors, and genre to make those recs.

On the recommend page you can add movies to your seen list to improve recommendations or add them to your watch list so you don't forget them.
