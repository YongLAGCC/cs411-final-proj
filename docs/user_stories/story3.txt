Logged-in user Home Page

If a logged in user returns to the web app, or if a non-logged-in user logs in, they’ll be taken to the logged-in user home page. This page will have:

* A list of movies you've seen.
* A list of movies you'd like to see.
* A “get movie recommendation” button.

Entering text into the search bar pulls up results as before, except now there’s an “add to seen-list” or “add to watch-list”.
